Brief description of your client and the site's purpose:
The client is John Rock, the owner of the local bar “Booyum”. John Rock wants a new webpage to promote upcoming events happening at their bar throughout the weeks. That way, customers can easily have access to the schedule and show up to the events that interest them. What more, for my two other pages, i made an menu page as well as a feed back page, where customeres can leave comments and feedback about the bar.

Design changes you made from Assignment 1 and why:
I made small changes in the code, such as importing a big majority of the code into a CSS code. I also did some modification with the fonts, since most of it was under 16pt, so for accecibility reasons, i made sure all of the font was 16pt or more. I also changed the font so that there's a continuity with the font style. Furthermore, I also added an navigation bar to the page, it's still a design change since it wasn't originally there.

AI Usage:
The tools i used what the build in chatbot AI of VS Code to help me understand the lines of code that the AI did to write the original page 1. I also used ChatGPT to help me when I had issues with my code. With the chatbot, I was able to understand that some of the codes was made with  Tailwind, which is, from what I understood, a way to write some CSS codes in a shorter way and directly into the HTML code. It ended up being useful when I wanted to make some minors changes to an section that already have an CSS label.
