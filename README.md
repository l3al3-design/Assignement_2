The tools i used what the build in chatbot AI of VS Code to help me understand the lines of code that the AI did to write the original page 1.
I also used ChatGPT to help me when I had issues with my code.
With the chatbot, I was able to understand that some of the codes was made with  Tailwind, which is, from what I understood, a way to write some CSS codes in a shorter way and directly into the HTML code.
It ended up being useful when I wanted to make some minors changes to an section that already have an CSS label.
